# CSV to JSON  

Needed data for my API in the JSON format for my gloang application.  
HappyDB is a collection of happy moments described by individuals experiencing those moments  
HappyDB provides 100,000 happy moments but in csv format  
So I need a Python tool to parse the CSV and format it into json file to import to my Firebase project.  
From my golang client I cand exploit that data like a real API
